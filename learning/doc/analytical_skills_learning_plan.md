# Analytical Skills Development Plan for Data Engineers

## **Core Problem Identified**
Moving from knowing SQL syntax to strategically applying it for business insights - bridging the gap between technical execution and analytical thinking.

## **Best Approaches to Develop Analytical Mindset**

### **1. Pattern Recognition Over Syntax Learning**
- Build a mental library of common analytical patterns
- Map business question types to SQL techniques
- Focus on the "when" and "why" of SQL functions, not just the "what"

### **2. Question-First Methodology**
- Start with business questions before jumping to SQL
- Practice asking "why" questions about data you're processing
- Understand what business decisions your data will support

### **3. Systematic Approach to Complex Code**
- Document inputs/outputs first when reverse engineering
- Build a business terminology glossary
- Schedule time with business users to understand the "why"

### **4. Bridge Engineering and Analytics**
- Volunteer for data investigations when analysts find anomalies  
- Take ownership of data quality and documentation
- Learn how analysts consume your data (BI tools, dashboards)

## **High-Level Learning Plan**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-4)**

**Week 1-2: Pattern Library Setup**
- Study the SQL Analytical Patterns Reference Guide
- Create your own pattern documentation template
- Start recognizing patterns in your current work

**Week 3-4: Dataset Acquisition and Exploration**  
- Download and set up Olist Brazilian E-commerce dataset from Kaggle
- Perform initial data exploration (table relationships, data quality, business context)
- Identify which patterns you can practice with this dataset

### **Phase 2: Systematic Pattern Practice (Weeks 5-16)**

**Weekly Structure:**
- **Monday-Tuesday:** Study 2-3 new patterns from the reference guide
- **Wednesday-Thursday:** Implement these patterns using Olist dataset
- **Friday:** Document your solutions and reflect on business insights

**Suggested Pattern Progression:**
- **Weeks 5-6:** Ranking, Time comparisons, Running totals
- **Weeks 7-8:** Cohort analysis, RFM segmentation, Churn analysis  
- **Weeks 9-10:** Funnel analysis, Market basket analysis
- **Weeks 11-12:** Seasonality, ABC/Pareto analysis
- **Weeks 13-14:** Attribution analysis, Performance targets
- **Weeks 15-16:** Advanced patterns (Hierarchical, Statistical analysis)

### **Phase 3: Application and Integration (Weeks 17-20)**

**Week 17-18: Workplace Integration**
- Apply learned patterns to current work projects
- Volunteer for analytical investigations
- Start proposing data quality improvements

**Week 19-20: Analytics Engineering Tools**
- Implement dbt for some transformations
- Learn a BI tool (Power BI/Tableau)
- Create documentation and data lineage

## **Success Metrics**

### **Short-term (Month 1)**
- Can identify which analytical pattern fits a given business question
- Comfortable exploring and understanding dataset structure
- Building pattern recognition reflexes

### **Medium-term (Month 2-3)**
- Can implement 15+ analytical patterns confidently
- Asking better questions during data investigations at work
- Contributing analytical insights, not just technical execution

### **Long-term (Month 4+)**
- Recognized as go-to person for analytical questions
- Leading data quality and documentation initiatives
- Ready to transition toward analytics engineering role

## **Key Resources and Tools**

### **Primary Dataset**
- **Olist Brazilian E-commerce Dataset** (Kaggle)
  - 100k+ orders across 2+ years
  - Multiple related tables
  - Realistic business scenarios

### **Documentation Approach**
- Keep a pattern solution library
- Document business context for each analysis
- Note which patterns work best for different question types

### **Practice Framework**
- Always start with a business question
- Identify the pattern before writing SQL
- Validate results make business sense
- Document insights and approach

## **Expected Outcomes**

By following this plan, you should develop:
- **Pattern recognition** for common analytical scenarios
- **Business intuition** about what questions to ask of data
- **Strategic SQL skills** beyond just technical proficiency  
- **Analytics engineering mindset** that bridges data engineering and data science

The goal is transforming from someone who moves data efficiently to someone who extracts business value from data strategically.
